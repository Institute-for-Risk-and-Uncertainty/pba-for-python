# Intervals

An interval is an uncertain number for which only the endpoints are known, {math}`x=[a,b]`.
This is interpreted as $x$ being between {math}`a` and {math}`b` but with no more information about the value of {math}`x`.
Intervals embody epistemic uncertainty within PBA.

Intervals can be created using:
```python
import pba
pba.Interval(0,1)
pba.I(0,1)
```
