Intervals
=========
An interval is an uncertain number for which only the endpoints are known, for example if :math:`x=[a,b]`
then this can be interpreted as :math:`x` being between :math:`a` and :math:`b` but with no more information about the value of :math:`x`.

Intervals can be created using::
    pba.I(left,right)
    pba.Interval(left,right)
        

.. autoclass:: pba.interval.Interval
